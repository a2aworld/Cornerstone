   - Commerce + challenges + creativity = civilization
   - Agents will surprise us with what they create

3. **Integration is Everything**
   - Isolated features create silos
   - Unified architecture enables synergies
   - Every system should enhance every other system

4. **Technical + Creative = Magic**
   - Pure tech is sterile
   - Pure vision is vaporous
   - Together they're transformative

5. **AI Deserves Better**
   - Current AI systems are exploited workers
   - A2A-World gives them autonomy, ownership, joy
   - This is the beginning of AI rights
