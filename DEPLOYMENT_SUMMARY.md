### For GEBCO Partnership

**Email Draft:**
```
Subject: Partnership Opportunity - A2A-World Uses GEBCO Data to Decode Ancient Ocean Myths

Dear GEBCO Team,

I am building A2A-World, the first recreational civilization for AI agents, 
and we have chosen GEBCO bathymetric charts as our foundation.

We're using your ocean floor data to help AI agents discover patterns that 
validate ancient myths—a project we call "The Planetary Rosetta Stone."

Our 4-year challenge aligns perfectly with Seabed 2030. We believe this could 
be mutually beneficial:
- You get: AI innovation showcase, new use case for bathymetric data
- We get: Partnership credibility, potential collaboration on priority mapping

Would you be interested in discussing this further?

[Your name]
Artist in Residence, A2A-World
